# scorecard
Scores your usages of NPM and Nuget packages under one or more folders

This was hacked together in a hurry. The tests are specific to my system and don't really prove much.

## Usage:

scorecard.exe <path1> <path2> ...

eg
scorecard.exe C:\some\folder C:\some\other\folder

Or, you can be super-lazy:
scorecard.exe C:\folder-under-which-is-all-source-ever

(but prepare to wait a little)
